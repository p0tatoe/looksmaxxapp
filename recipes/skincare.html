        <h2>How to Start a Skincare Routine</h2>
        <p>Starting a skincare routine can be overwhelming with so many products and tips out there. Here's a simple guide to help you get started on the path to healthier skin:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Know Your Skin Type</h3>
        <p>Understanding your skin type is crucial for selecting the right products. The main skin types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Balanced, not too oily or dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Oily:</strong> Prone to excess sebum and shine.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry:</strong> Lacks moisture and may feel tight or flaky.</li>
            <li><strong>Combination:</strong> Oily in some areas (like the T-zone) and dry in others.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensitive:</strong> Easily irritated and may react to certain products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Start with the Basics</h3>
        <p>A basic skincare routine involves three main steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cleansing:</strong> Use a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and makeup without stripping your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li><strong>Moisturizing:</strong> Apply a moisturizer suited to your skin type to keep your skin hydrated and balanced.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day, even if it's cloudy or you're indoors.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Introduce Products Gradually</h3>
        <p>As you become more comfortable with your basic routine, you can start introducing additional products such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Toners:</strong> Help to balance the skin's pH and remove any leftover impurities.</li>
            <li><strong>Serums:</strong> Concentrated treatments that target specific concerns like wrinkles, dark spots, or acne.</li>
            <li><strong>Exfoliants:</strong> Remove dead skin cells to reveal a brighter complexion. Use 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li><strong>Face Masks:</strong> Provide intensive treatment for specific issues. Use as needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Be Consistent</h3>
        <p>Consistency is key to seeing results. Stick to your routine and be patient; it can take a few weeks to notice significant changes.</p>

        <h3>5. Listen to Your Skin</h3>
        <p>Your skin's needs can change due to factors like weather, hormones, and stress. Pay attention to how your skin responds and adjust your routine accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Starting a skincare routine doesn't have to be complicated. By understanding your skin type, sticking to the basics, and gradually introducing new products, you can achieve healthier, more radiant skin. Remember, the best routine is one that you can maintain consistently.</p>
